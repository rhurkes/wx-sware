## Critical

## Backlog
- keyboard controls and click outside the menu to close it
- get WFO details including bounds
- distance filter for afd
- better UX for promoting first interaction on page, so speech synth will work
- alerts will have distance when gps is live

## Tech debt
- bundling
- convert to typescript
- write tests
