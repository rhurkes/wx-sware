# Testing
`open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir`

# TODO
## Critical
- better UX for promoting first interaction on page, so speech synth will work
## Backlog
- keyboard controls and click outside the menu to close it
- get WFO details including bounds
- distance filter for afd
- alerts will have distance when gps is live
- cardinality for distance

## Tech debt
- bundling
- convert to typescript
- write tests
